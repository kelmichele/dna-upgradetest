DNA/Paternity testing determines the biological father of a child. We all inherit our DNA from our biological parents, half from our mother and half from our father. A DNA paternity test compares a child’s DNA pattern with that of an “alleged father” to determine if there is a match. When performed correctly in an experienced laboratory, it’s the most definitive proof of a biological relationship.


The DNA parentage test that follows strict chain of custody can generate legally admissible results that re used for child support, inheritance, social welfare benefits, immigration, or adoption purposes. To satisfy the chain-of-custody legal requirements, all tested parties have to be properly identified and their specimens collected by one of our trained professionals who is not related to any of the tested parties and has no interest in the outcome of the test.


In the United States, paternity testing is fully legal, and fathers may test their children without the consent or knowledge of the mother. Paternity testing take-home kits are not admissible in court, and are for personal knowledge only. Only a court-ordered paternity test may be used as evidence in court proceedings.


For unmarried parents, if a parent is currently receiving child support or custody, but DNA proves that the man is not the father later on, the support automatically stops; however, in many states this testing must be performed during a narrow time window if a voluntary acknowledgment of parentage form has already been signed by the putative father; otherwise, the results of the test may be disregarded by law, and in many cases a man may be required to pay child support even though the child is biologically unrelated. In a few states, if the mother is receiving the support, then that alleged father has the right to file a lawsuit to get back any money that he lost from paying support. As of 2011, and in most states, unwed parents confronted with a voluntary acknowledgement of parentage form are informed of the possibility and right to request a DNA paternity test. If testing is refused by the mother, the father may not be required to sign the birth certificate or the voluntary acknowledgement of parentage form for the child. For wedded putative parents, the husband of the mother is presumed to be the father of the child. However, in most states, this presumption can be overturned by the application of a forensic paternity test, but in many states the time for overturn this presumption may be limited to the first few years of the child’s life, depending on the law of the state in question.
